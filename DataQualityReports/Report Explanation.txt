During processing, the VertNet toolkit ("migrator") transforms data from it's original fields and their content into fields, formats, and vocabularies consistent with the Darwin Core and with the purpose of facilitating discovery. In many cases, the changes made during processing reveal data that could be improved at the source. Following is a list of reports generated during processing for VertNet showing how to interpret their contents. The square brackets indicate that the name of the data set to which the report applies, such as "Birds", "EggsNets", "Fish", "Fossils", "Herps", "Mammals", or "Verts".

	institutionCode - the value of the institutionCode for the processed data set.

Report-LinesWithNonprintingCharacters.txt
  This report contains a list of the differences between records before and after data processing removed non-printing (e.g., tab, vertical tab, new line) characters from the content of fields in the data. The report is a result of the execution of the Unix diff command on the files before and after removing the non-printing characters. To understand the report, refer to documentation on the diff command.
